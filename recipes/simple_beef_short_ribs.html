    <h2>What Is Beef Short Ribs?</h2>    
        <p>Beef short ribs are a cut of beef that come from the brisket, chuck, 
            plate, or rib areas of the cow. 
            They consist of a short portion of the rib bone and the surrounding meat, 
            which can be cut in two main ways: "flanken" or "English" cut. 
            The "flanken" cut is made across the bone, leaving the bone just 1 to 2 inches in length, 
            while the "English" cut is made parallel to the bone, 
            leaving the bone up to 6 inches in length. 
            Short ribs are known for their rich, 
            beefy flavor and are prized for slow cooking due to their high fat content, 
            which makes the meat tender and succulent. 
            They are popular in many international cuisines and are often used for braising or slow cooking to break down the tough connective tissues
            and make the meat fall apart tender.
